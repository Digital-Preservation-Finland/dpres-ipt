# Instructions


 1. Start ingest server with vagrant up.

 1. Install msysgit first if you are windows user (http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list). 
    Go to scratch directory first, in windows users case go to Git bash and give commands below. 
    Linux and Mac users just use command line.
    
  		cd /c/workspace/home/tenhunen/scratch
  		while true ; do rsync -e ssh -avz microservice spock@ingest:scratch/ ; sleep 1 ; done
  		
  	This will synchronize tests and microservice code to ingest server
  
  3. On ingest server run
  
  		cd /home/spock/scratch/microservice
  		while true; do make test; sleep 5 ; done
  		
  		
  	Now the tests are being built and run and you should see following text (or similar)		
  
  		# Run tests
    	prove t
   	 	t/01_test_unzip.t .. ok
      	All tests successful.
		Files=1, Tests=3,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.02 CPU)
		Result: PASS
		
	If you want to see time statistics of tests run
	
		while true; do time make test; sleep 5 ; done
	
	Now you have established continuous deployment and automated unit testing 
	
	4. Enjoy programming!
